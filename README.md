# FastList<T> and CharArray
  A `FastList<T>` is a replacement for a `List<T>`, which performs a bit faster because it doesn't do as much extra work for convenience and/or safety.  The biggest risk is that a `FastList` can reduce its count without removing items from its internal array - so asking it for an index which is outside of the `count` range, but inside of the "array length" range, will silently fail (by returning a value instead of reporting "out of bounds").  For example, `myFastList.Clear()` will set `count` to zero, but will not perform any changes to the internal array.  `myFastList.HardClear()` can be used instead, if you need to make sure that all values/references are deleted from the internal array, as well.
  
  A `CharArray` inherits from `FastList<char>`, and is specifically intended to be used with TextMeshPro.  TMPro allows you to set the text content of a textbox by providing a `char[]` and a count - CharArray can provide it with these things, and it gives you some handy `Append()` functions for appending text, integers, or float values.
  
  Generally, you should be able to feel out the usage of `FastList` and `CharArray` by checking the hints in their autocomplete-popups.
