# FastList<T> and CharArray
  A `FastList<T>` is a replacement for a `List<T>`, which performs a bit faster because it doesn't do as much extra work for convenience and/or safety.  The biggest risk is that a `FastList` can reduce its count without removing items from its internal array - so asking it for an index which is outside of the `count` range, but inside of the "array length" range, will silently fail (by returning a value instead of reporting "out of bounds").  For example, `myFastList.Clear()` will set `count` to zero, but will not perform any changes to the internal array.  `myFastList.HardClear()` can be used instead, if you need to make sure that all values/references are deleted from the internal array, as well.
  
  A `CharArray` inherits from `FastList<char>`, and is specifically intended to be used with TextMeshPro.  TMPro allows you to set the text content of a textbox by providing a `char[]` and a count - CharArray can provide it with these things, and it gives you some handy `Append()` functions for appending strings, integers, and float values.
  
  Generally, you should be able to feel out the usage of `FastList` and `CharArray` by checking the hints in their autocomplete-popups.  They're very simple, so it should be pretty easy to add your own extra features to them, as well.  Let me know if you add cool stuff that seems like it'd be useful to other folks!
